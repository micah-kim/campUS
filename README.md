# HackMIT 2022 Project: CampUS

## Introduction

Currently, there is no centralized platform that is user-friendly and intuitive to access events from different clubs and organizations on campus.
This is where CampUS comes into play by introducing a new and user-friendly way to see the many different events held throughout campus by different clubs. Flaunting a fluid interface model, CampUS is a new and fun way to make the most out of your life outside of class!

## Features

* Main page includes navigation functionality of events from different organizations with filters to see specific categories.
* Can click and explore different clubs with descriptions and comments.
* Able to post an event as a club with title, description, and date. Also able to categorize each event based on posting club's identity.
* Each event holds a phone number and email address that can be clicked on to contact the event organizers.

## How to Use

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the my-app folder and do:
```
npm install
npm start
```

Enjoy this prototype web app!
